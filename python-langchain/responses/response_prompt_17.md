User: Add a Tool object to the tools list that:
- Has name="reverse_string"
- Uses the reverse_string function as func
- Has a description: "Reverses a string. Input should be a single string."
- Ensure all three tools are uncommented (Calculator, get_current_time, reverse_string)

GitHub Copilot: Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/mikdo/CodeYou/ai-agent-lab/python-langchain/app.py#75-75), lines 75 to 110

Replacing 18 lines with 23 lines in [](file:///c%3A/Users/mikdo/CodeYou/ai-agent-lab/python-langchain/app.py)


```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the tools list to include all three tools:

✅ **Calculator** - Uncommented and ready to handle mathematical expressions
✅ **get_current_time** - Uncommented and ready to provide current date/time
✅ **reverse_string** - Added with name "reverse_string", using the reverse_string function, and the description "Reverses a string. Input should be a single string."

All three tools are now active and available for the AI agent to use when processing queries.

Made changes.
