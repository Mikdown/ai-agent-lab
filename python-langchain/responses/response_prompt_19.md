Perfect! I've updated the output formatting with:

✅ **Separator lines** - Using `print("─" * 50)` (already in place)
✅ **Better spacing** - Changed from single newline to double newlines between queries (`print("\n")`)
✅ **Completion message** - Added `print("🎉 Agent demo complete!")` at the end of the query loop

The output will now have better visual separation between queries and end with the celebration message.

Made changes.
