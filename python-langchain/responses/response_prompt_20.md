User: Update the agent initialization to include a system message that instructs the AI to be professional and succinct. Add this configuration when creating the agent.

Perfect! I've updated the system message in the agent initialization to include instructions for the AI to be professional and succinct. The new system message now:

✅ **Instructs the AI to be professional and succinct** - "You are a professional and succinct AI assistant. Provide clear, concise responses without unnecessary elaboration."

✅ **Lists all available tools** - References Calculator, get_current_time, and reverse_string tools

✅ **Emphasizes appropriate tool usage** - Instructs the AI to use the appropriate tool when needed

✅ **Reinforces professional tone and efficiency** - "Be professional in tone and efficient in your responses."

This configuration will guide the AI to provide focused, professional answers while leveraging the available tools effectively.

Made changes.
